Hi, there! My name's Hannah, and I'm a twenty-year-old college student who's
trying to enjoy the fun in life. (By that I mean that I grow a lot of plants and
like a strong cup of tea). I grew up in a small town surrounded by cornfields,
but now I live in Chicago-a big change, I know. I'm studying chemical engineering
which means that I take a LOT of chemistry classes, math classes, and ... other
classes in the hopes that I can one day learn to mesh all this knowledge together
and solve some real problems for a factory. But enough about my major-we'll get
to that later. What else would you like to know about me? I could tell you that
I have a cat named Socks, a best friend named Lauren, and a brother named Kyle.
Or maybe you'd like to know that my favorite season is fall, my favorite color
is green (like this), and my favorite book is Ender's game.
